# Audio-Style-Transfer

The task is to perform audio style transfer through the use of Mel spectrograms with a CNN using a VGG-19. The first milestone, this status report, uses a VGG visual pre-trained style transfer model, and writes scripts that prepare the training data (audio-to-spectrogram) and perform the final conversion into an audible output format (spectrogram-to-audio) through the use of a pre-trained WaveNet vocoder.
